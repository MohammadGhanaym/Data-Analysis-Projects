### Exploring US Bikeshare Data
<a id='Exploring US Bikeshare Data'></a>
Exploring data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Importing the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Writing a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Investigate Movies Dataset
<a id='Investigate Movies Dataset'></a>
We started with assessing the data visually and programmatically. Then, we cleaned the data to be ready for exploration. We took a look at the dataset and brainstormed what questions I could answer using it. Then, I used Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions that I'm most interested in and created a report sharing the answers.

### Analyze A/B Test Results

<a id='Analyze A/B Test Results'></a>
Working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Communicate Data Findings (Ford Gobike Data System)
<a id='Communicate Data Findings (Ford Gobike Data System)'></a>

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, Using Python visualization libraries to systematically explore Ford Gobike System Data, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset.

### Communicate Data Findings (Telco Customer Churn Data)
<a id='Communicate Data Findings (Telco Customer Churn Data)'></a>

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, Using Python visualization libraries to systematically explore Telco Customer Churn Data, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset. 


### Top Countries for Business Expansion
<a id='Top Countries for Business Expansion'></a>

In this project, I analyzed key indicators from the [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) website to assist stakeholders in identifying the best countries for opening a new business. I used metrics such as:  

- GDP per capita (price and inflation-adjusted, in PPP$2021)  
- Population size  
- Population growth (annual %)  
- Urban population (% of total)  
- Human Development Index (HDI)  
- Ease of Doing Business score  
- Cost of business start-up procedures

### Analyzing Databel Customer Churn
<a id='Analyzing Databel Customer Churn'></a>
We will be analyzing a fictitious churn dataset from a Telecom provider called Databel to know why customers are churning. The Databel dataset consists of 29 columns with one row per customer. We'll be analyzing a snapshot of the database at a specific time, meaning there is no time dimension. If you want to know more about the data check out the Metadata Sheet - Customer Churn file. There are two sheets:

- Databel - Customer
- Databel - Aggreate: The aggregate views are based on data in Databel - Customer.
#### **Skills Used**
- Creating calculated columns.
- Transforming and cleaning data.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Building pivot tables and creating data visualizations.
