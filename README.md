### Bridging the Gap: Addressing the 37% Loss in Hardware Opportunities
<a id='CRM-Sales-Opportunities-Analysis'></a>  
In this analysis, I will help a computer hardware company evaluate the performance of its sales teams and agents and identify which products have the highest win rates. By analyzing key metrics such as total bookings, average deal size, win rate, and time to close, we will uncover actionable insights to improve sales performance, reduce lost opportunities, and drive profitability.

### Exploring US Bikeshare Data  
<a id='exploring-us-bikeshare-data'></a>  
This project explores bike share system data for three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I computed descriptive statistics and created an interactive terminal experience to present insights about bike usage patterns, peak hours, and user demographics.  

**Skills Used:**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Descriptive Statistics  
- Interactive Scripting

### Analyze A/B Test Results  
<a id='analyze-ab-test-results'></a>  
I analyzed the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce website to determine whether a new web page design led to higher conversion rates. Using statistical methods and logistic regression, I provided recommendations on whether to implement the new design.  

**Skills Used:**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- A/B Testing  
- Logistic Regression  
- Hypothesis Testing
