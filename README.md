### Exploring US Bikeshare Data
<a id='Exploring US Bikeshare Data'></a>
Exploring data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Importing the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Writing a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Investigate Movies Dataset
<a id='Investigate Movies Dataset'></a>
Investigating the movies dataset. Creating a file to share that documents my findings. Taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I'm most interested in and create a report sharing the answers. 

### Analyze A/B Test Results

<a id='Analyze A/B Test Results'></a>
Working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Communicate Data Findings (Ford Gobike Data System)
<a id='Communicate Data Findings (Ford Gobike Data System)'></a>

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, Using Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset. 

### Investigate Medical Appointment No Shows 2016
<a id='Investigate Medical Appointment No Shows 2016'></a>
Investigating the no-show appointments dataset. Creating a file to share that documents my findings. Taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I'm most interested in and create a report sharing the answers.
