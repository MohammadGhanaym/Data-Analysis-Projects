    "# Overview  \n",
    "In this project, I will analyze the company's financial data to help track its profit, revenue, and expenses over time and evaluate cash flow trends. I will examine revenue by region to identify which regions are performing well and which are not. Additionally, I will assess employee performance to determine which employees deserve investment in their talents. Furthermore, I will analyze customer churn and identify whether high-value customers are leaving. This will help draw the company's attention to retaining these valuable customers.  \n",

    "# Business Goal  \n",
    "- Develop a dashboard summarizing financial performance, including revenue, expenses, net profit, and cash flow trends over time.\n",
    "- Break down revenue by segment, region, and customer type to identify strong-performing areas and those that need attention.  \n",
    "- Provide insights into customer retention rates and satisfaction. Are we losing clients? If so, why?  \n",
    "- Analyze employee performance data and its correlation with financial outcomes. Are we investing in the right talent?"
