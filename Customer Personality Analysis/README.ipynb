    "## Overview (In Progress)\n",
    "Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps businesses better understand their customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging customer personality analysis, businesses can tailor their products based on target customer segments. Instead of marketing a new product to every customer in the database, companies can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and focus their marketing efforts accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions to Answer\n",
    "1. Does the education level affect the number of accepted offers?  \n",
    "2. Does marital status affect the number of accepted offers?  \n",
    "3. Are customers with dependents more likely to accept an offer?  \n",
    "4. Which age group is more likely to accept an offer?  \n",
    "5. Are customers with higher incomes more likely to accept an offer?  \n",
    "6. Are customers who spend more money on fruits more likely to accept an offer?  \n",
    "7. Are customers who spend more money on meat products more likely to accept an offer?  \n",
    "8. Are customers who spend more money on fish products more likely to accept an offer?  \n",
    "9. Are customers who spend more money on sweet products more likely to accept an offer?  \n",
    "10. Are customers who have a higher number of website visits and online purchases in the last month more likely to accept an offer?  \n",
    "11. Are customers who have made more purchases in stores and through catalogs more likely to accept an offer?  \n",
    "12. Are customers who frequently use discounts for purchases more likely to accept an offer?  \n",

    "## Data Gathering\n",
    "In this project, I will use a dataset downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).  \n",

    "1. **Drop rows with missing values** in the **`Income`** column.  \n",
    "   - Since there are only **13 null values**, which represent a very small proportion of the dataset, removing them is unlikely to significantly affect the analysis results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert the data type** of the **`Dt_Customer`** column to **Date** type.  \n",
    "   - When I tried to change the type directly, I encountered an error because the data follows the **day-month-year** format. To resolve this, I converted it using the **Brazilian locale**, as this dataset is related to a food delivery app in Brazil, and it worked.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Drop unnecessary columns** for analysis: `Z_costContact`, `Z_revenue`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create a new column** named `AcceptedCmp`, which represents the number of offers the customer has accepted, excluding the last campaign.\n",
    "5. **Create a new column** named `Customer Age` to represent the customer's age.  \n",
    "   - Since the data was last updated in 2020, I calculated the customer's age by subtracting their year of birth from 2020.\n",
    "   - After creating the column I found 3 customers with ages of more than 100 so, I deleted those values.\n",

    "   - There are only **two rows** with the value `YOLO`, and they contain identical information except for the `ID`. Therefore, I will drop them.  \n",
    "   - There are also **two rows** with the value `Absurd`. Since I am unsure which category they belong to, I will drop them.  \n",
    "   - There are **inconsistent values** such as `Alone` and `Single`, which have the same meaning. To maintain consistency, I will replace `Alone` with `Single`.\n",
    "   - Now, we only have Single, Together, Married, Divorced, and Widow.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. Create a new column called `Dependents` that represents the total number of dependents (kids + teenagers)."
