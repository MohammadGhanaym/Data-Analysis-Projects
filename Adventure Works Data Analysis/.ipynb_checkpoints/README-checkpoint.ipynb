    "## Overview\n",
    "In this project, I'm going to analyze transactional data that has been gathered over 4 years. The main goal of this analysis is to create visual representations of the data to assess the performance over these years. The primary interest of the stakeholders is in analyzing the profit. Specifically, the focus will be on the analysis of products, customer locations (countries), and time trends to identify any patterns or trends."
