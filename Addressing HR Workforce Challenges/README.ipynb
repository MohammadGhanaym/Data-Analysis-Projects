    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem Presented:**\n",
    "XYZ company manages thousands of employees spread across dozens of projects in different countries. During the year 2024, the executive management began to notice worrying indicators:\n",
    "*   High employee turnover rates in some locations\n",
    "*   Teams suffering from excessive pressure, and others with hardly any tasks\n",
    "*   Operational costs are constantly rising without a clear explanation\n",
    "*   Difficulty in predicting the efficiency of human resources in new projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Management immediately asked the analysis team to intervene. But the challenge is not just about analysis, but about building an intelligent and dynamic system that supports real-time decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required:**\n",
    "You are now a data analyst within an operational emergency team, and your task is:\n",
    "*   **Understand the complete picture:**\n",
    "    Start from raw data scattered among employee files, project details, daily tasks, and attendance and departure records.\n",
    "*   **Data processing and linking:**\n",
    "*   **Analysis of the root causes of the problem:**\n",
    "    *   What is the reason for the high employee turnover?\n",
    "    *   Why does productivity vary between locations?\n",
    "    *   How are tasks distributed? Is there a problem with scheduling?\n",
    "*   **Designing \"What-if\" scenarios:**\n",
    "    What would happen if:\n",
    "    *   Were employees rotated between projects?\n",
    "    *   Work hours increased or decreased?\n",
    "    *   Task distribution changed based on efficiency?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Creating an intelligent automation system:**\n",
    "    Management does not want a one-time analysis, but a living model:\n",
    "    So that the system is ready to support decision-making at any time, and whenever the data changes, the results and analyses are automatically updated.\n",
    "    It saves effort and time for the operational teams.\n",
    "*   **Proposing practical solutions for the year 2025:**\n",
    "    Present an operational plan based on data and realistic analysis.\n",
    "    Explain with numbers how resource allocation can be improved and waste reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline: Sunday, June 1, 2025**\n",
    "\n",
    "The important things are the methodology, the deep analysis, the ability to present the outputs in a way that reflects your thinking process, and the ability to turn chaos into a clear and executable vision."
