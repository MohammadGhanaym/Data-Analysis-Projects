### Which dataset you chose?

**Ford GoBike System Data**
\
Data consists of info about trips taken by service's members, their types, their age, their gender, stations of starting and ending trips, duration of trips etc.

### Main findings from the exploratory data analysis
   - Most trips take less than 30 minutes.
   - Only 0.77 of the trips are of duration more than an hour. These data points need more investigations.
   - We can see that most trips are from 8 am - 9 am and 5 pm - 6 pm. I think this is related to the time when people go to work or school, and when they go back home.
   - The number of trips increases gradually until it reaches the maximum on Thursday, then it decreases until it reaches the minimum on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday and Sunday are the weekends in the United States of America. This supports the fact that the number of trips increases on the workdays and decreases on the weekend.
   - 76.18 % of users are males, and 23.82 % of users are females.
   - Most of the users are 20 to 40 years, and this is the age group that works or studies. This also supports the fact that the number of trips is related to people who work or study. This distribution is consistent with the distribution of weekdays. Both support the fact that the number of trips is related to people who work or study.
   - 9.41 % of users are Customers, and 90.59 % of users are subscribers.
   - 90.26 % of users don't share at all trips whereas, 9.74 % of users share at all trips.
   - The duration on Saturday and Sunday is greater than the rest of the days. I think people on weekends use bikes for entertainment.
   - The median duration doesn't differ so much between hours.
   - The trip duration for females is greater than for males, but the difference is very tiny.
   - The relationship between trip duration and members' age is negative. And this makes sense since older members can't ride for a long time.
   - Customers go on trips longer in duration than subscribers. The number of subscribers who go on less than 10-minute trips is greater than the number of customers who do so.
   - People who share in every trip are the majority to go on fewer than 10-minute duration trips whereas, people who don't share in every trip go on long-duration trips, but with a tiny difference.
   - 69.72 % of users are subscribers and males.
   - Now, we can see that people who ride bikes at 8 am-9 am or 5 pm-6 pm are subscribers. This is related to the time when people go to work or study. Those people are subscribers.
   - There are more subscribers than customers in the times when people go to work or school or when they leave. Number of customers is consistent along the days of the week. It's clear that customers use bikes for fun or entertainment. Most of subscribers are males since I think number of males who work is greater than females, and I think the clothes of work have a big impact on that.
   - Customers go on consistently long trips duration than subscribers at all times during the day. Customers' trips are long at midnight, and especially at midday.
   - The trips duration for subscribers is consistent across all the days of the week whereas, the trip's duration increases for customers on the weekends.
   - Whether females are subscribers or customers, they go on long-duration trips than males.
   - Whether they are males or females, people who don't share in every trip go on long-duration trips. People who share in every trip go on short-duration trips.
   - The reason why females go on longer duration trips than males. This is because females are younger than males, and we saw before that the relationship between duration and ages is negative.
   - The median ages for females, and males whether they are customers, or subscribers are consistent.
   - The number of young people who share in every trip is greater than the number of old people.

### How you chose the results to put in your explanatory analysis.
I choose the result that related to trips duration, and will help me get a conclusion about it.
You will find the age of members the most impact feature in trip durations. You will find that the number of females is less than the number of males, but females go on long-duration trips than males. This is because females are younger than males. It doesn't matter whether they are customers or subscribers. In all cases, you will find females go on longer duration trips than males.
