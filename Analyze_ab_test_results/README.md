## Conclusions

***Do you think there is sufficient evidence to say that the new treatment page leads to more conversions?***
- **From the perspective of the probability:**
    - I think there is not sufficient evidence to say the new treatment page leads to more conversions. As you can see,   regardless of the received page, the probability of conversion is very low. And if an individual in the control group, the probability of conversion is low. And if an individual in the treatment group, the probability of conversion is low too. The probability of an individual received the new page is 50%, which tells us that only half of the people receive the new page. I think they need more time so that all people receive the new page.
- **From the perspective of A/B testing:**
    - The P-value is greater than the type I error rate of 5%.
    - We do not have statistically significant evidence to suggest the population difference is greater than 0. (Fail to reject the null)
    - The P-value and the z-score tell us that we fail to reject the null.
    - We are 95% not confident that the new page conversion rate is greater than the old page conversion rate as the P-value is greater than the type I error rate of 5%.
- **From the perspective of regression**
    - Using only landing page, we got that the new page is 1.015 less likely to be converted than the old page. We failed to reject the null.
    - Using the countries and landing page, it seems that the country does not affect the conversion rate. CA and US are not statistically significant.
    - Using the interaction between the country and ab_page, all the coefficients are not statistically significant. 
> ***From the results above, we don't have enough evidence that the new page conversion rate is better than the old page conversion rate.***
